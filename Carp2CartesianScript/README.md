# Carp2Cartesian Script Version
This directory provides a scripted version of the CARP to Cartesian conversion tool.

You can use the GUI version of the app from [here](../Carp2CartesianApp/).

## Installation instructions

After cloning the repository, add this directory to MATLAB's search path. [You can read more about how to add a directory to MATLAB's search path here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html).

## Instructions for use

A sample script file is included in this directory as [SampleScript.m](./SampleScript.m).

Copy this file to the directory where the CARP and `summary` file are in. Change MATLAB's current directory to that folder and open the script file.

The file has in-depth comments on how to convert the CARP file into a Cartesian JSON mesh. Edit the file as needed and run the script in MATLAB.

Follow the Instructions for Use in the README.md file from [../Carp2CartesianApp](../Carp2CartesianApp/) for more information.
